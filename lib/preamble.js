/*
 * Lazy.js is a lazy evaluation library for JavaScript.
 *
 * This has been done before. For examples see:
 *
 * - [wu.js](http://fitzgen.github.io/wu.js/)
 * - [Linq.js](http://linqjs.codeplex.com/)
 * - [from.js](https://github.com/suckgamoni/fromjs/)
 * - [IxJS](http://rx.codeplex.com/)
 * - [sloth.js](http://rfw.name/sloth.js/)
 *
 * However, at least at present, Lazy.js is faster (on average) than any of
 * those libraries. It is also more complete, with nearly all of the
 * functionality of [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) and
 * [Lo-Dash](http://lodash.com/).
 *
 * Finding your way around the code
 * --------------------------------
 *
 * At the heart of Lazy.js is the {@link Sequence} object. You create an initial
 * sequence using {@link Lazy}, which can accept an array, object, or string.
 * You can then "chain" together methods from this sequence, creating a new
 * sequence with each call.
 *
 * Here's an example:
 *
 *     var data = getReallyBigArray();
 *
 *     var statistics = Lazy(data)
 *       .map(transform)
 *       .filter(validate)
 *       .reduce(aggregate);
 *
 * {@link Sequence} is the foundation of other, more specific sequence types.
 *
 * An {@link ArrayLikeSequence} provides indexed access to its elements.
 *
 * An {@link ObjectLikeSequence} consists of key/value pairs.
 *
 * A {@link StringLikeSequence} is like a string (duh): actually, it is an
 * {@link ArrayLikeSequence} whose elements happen to be characters.
 *
 * An {@link AsyncSequence} is special: it iterates over its elements
 * asynchronously (so calling `each` generally begins an asynchronous loop and
 * returns immediately).
 *
 * For more information
 * --------------------
 *
 * I wrote a blog post that explains a little bit more about Lazy.js, which you
 * can read [here](http://philosopherdeveloper.com/posts/introducing-lazy-js.html).
 *
 * You can also [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/dtao/lazy.js/issues)
 * if you have any issues with the library. I work through them eventually.
